# Manifest Prompts Portfolio

| Name 	| Promt 	| Description 	| Example 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Pod 	| Create a Pod manifest for your application. 	| Defines a Pod, which is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It encapsulates one or more containers and represents a running process in the cluster 	| [pod.yaml](./yaml/pod.yaml) 	|
| Pod with Liveness Probe 	| Create a Pod manifest with a liveness probe. 	| Specifies a liveness probe to periodically check the health of the containers within the Pod and restart them if necessary. 	| [pod-liveness-probe.yaml](./yaml/pod-liveness-probe.yaml) |
| Pod with Readiness Probe	| Create a Pod manifest with a readiness probe.	| Defines a readiness probe to indicate whether the containers within the Pod are ready to receive traffic, helping to ensure smooth application deployments.	| [pod-readiness-probe.yaml](./yaml/pod-readiness-probe.yaml)	|
| Pod with Volume	| Create a Pod manifest with a volume.	| Demonstrates how to define a volume and mount it into the containers within the Pod, allowing data to be shared between containers or persisted.	| [pod-volumeMounts.yaml](./yaml/pod-volumeMounts.yaml)	|
| Pod with CronJob	| Create a Pod manifest with a CronJob.	| Defines a CronJob, which is used to schedule and run Jobs at specified time intervals using a cron-like syntax. The Pod runs as part of the Job according to the specified schedule.	| [pod-cronjob.yaml](./yaml/pod-cronjob.yaml)	|
| Pod with Job and Rsync	| Create a Pod manifest with a Job and use rsync for data synchronization.	| Defines a Job that runs a Pod and utilizes the rsync tool to synchronize data between the Pod and a remote location. This can be useful for tasks such as backup, data replication, or file transfer.	| [pod-job-rsync.yaml](./yaml/pod-job-rsync.yaml)	|
| Multi-Container Pod	| Create a Pod manifest with multiple containers.	| Defines a Pod that includes multiple containers running within the same Pod. Each container can serve a different purpose, such as a web server, a database, or a sidecar container for logging or monitoring.	| [pod-multicontainer.yaml](./yaml/pod-multicontainer.yaml)	|
| CPU and Memory Limits + Requests	| Set CPU and memory limits and requests for a Pod.	| Combines CPU and memory limits and requests in a Pod manifest, allowing you to define both the maximum limits and minimum requests for CPU and memory resources. This provides fine-grained control over resource allocation and ensures that Pods have appropriate resource guarantees and limits.	| [pod-resources.yaml](./yaml/pod-resources.yaml)	|
| Secret as Environment Variables	| Use a secret as environment variables in a Pod.	| Demonstrates how to use a Kubernetes Secret to populate sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, as environment variables in a Pod. This approach helps to keep sensitive information secure and separate from the Pod's manifest, making it easier to manage and rotate secrets independently.	| [pod-secret-env.yaml](./yaml/pod-secret-env.yaml)	|
